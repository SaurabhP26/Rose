# Agent Architecture

This project follows a 3-layer agentic architecture to organize agent workflows and artifacts.

## Directory Structure

### `directives/`
Contains high-level instruction files, goals, and requirements documents that guide the agent's behavior.
- **Examples**: `prd.md`, `style_guide.md`, `system_instructions.md`.

### `execution/`
Contains logs, plans, and persistent artifacts generated by the agent during task execution.
- **Examples**: `implementation_plan.md`, `task.md`, `walkthrough.md`.

### `.tmp/`
A temporary scratchpad for the agent to store intermediate files, diffs, or download content.
- **Note**: This directory is git-ignored and should not contain permanent project code.

## Core Files

- **AGENTS.md**: The master documentation for this architecture.
- **CLAUDE.md**: A symlink/mirror of `AGENTS.md` to ensure context availability for Anthropic models.
- **GEMINI.md**: A symlink/mirror of `AGENTS.md` to ensure context availability for Google models.
